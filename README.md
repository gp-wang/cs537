# cs537  
CS-537: Introduction to Operating Systems, University of Wisconsin, Madison 

These are the projects of my OS classes. Each project contains two parts:  
linux: this is the linux programming part  
xv6: this is the V6 Unix (xv6) kernel hacking part  

p1\linux: write a fastsort program under linux  
p1\xv6: setup the xv6 simulation environment. Implement system call getsyscallinfo()  

p2\linux: implement a command line interpreter or, as it is more commonly known, a shell.   
p2\xv6: putting a new scheduler into xv6. It is a mix of two schedulers: the multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ) we heard about in class and is described in this chapter and the lottery scheduler  

p3\linux:  Implement memory library, malloc() and free().  
p3\xv6:  Debug the two-level page table in xv6 and fix its null pointer

p4\linux:  developing a scalable web server, using pthread library and producer, consumer model  
p4\xv6: build kernel thread library, including thread_create() , lock_acquire() , lock_release() , and cv_signal() and cv_wait() functions. 

p5\linux: developing a working distributed file server with UDP protocol. Implement the log-structure-based file system. 
p5\xv6: no xv6 part for p5
